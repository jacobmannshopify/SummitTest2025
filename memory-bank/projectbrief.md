# Project Brief: Test Research AI Agent

## Vision
Build a web-based AI Research Agent that empowers users to conduct, organise, and collaborate on research tasks using state-of-the-art language models.

## Core Objectives
1. Provide an interactive chat interface for natural language research queries and AI-generated responses.
2. Enable long-term context management, citation handling, and knowledge retrieval from uploaded/linked documents.
3. Support collaborative research sessions with real-time updates and exported deliverables.
4. Maintain high performance, scalability, and security suitable for production deployment on Vercel.

## Scope & Milestones (mapped to Roadmap Phases)
- **Phase 1 – Project Setup & Infrastructure**: Initialise Next.js codebase, configure tooling, database, and auth.
- **Phase 2 – Core AI Agent Features**: Integrate OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, implement prompt & context management, vector search, and knowledge base.
- **Phase 3 – User Interface Development**: Build chat UI, research dashboard, and settings pages.
- **Phase 4 – Advanced Features**: Integrate external research tools, collaboration, and performance optimisation.
- **Phase 5 – Testing & Deployment**: Automated tests, security hardening, CI/CD, and monitoring.
- **Phase 6 – Documentation & Maintenance**: Comprehensive docs and long-term maintenance strategy.

## Success Criteria
- Users can complete research tasks end-to-end without leaving the platform.
- System handles concurrent sessions with minimal latency (<200 ms average response render).
- 80% code coverage across unit & integration tests.
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities at launch.
- Positive user feedback (NPS > 40) within first month of beta.
