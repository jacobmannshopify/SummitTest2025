## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Slight audio delay on first play** - Web Audio API limitation
2. **Particle effects can cause minor FPS drops on low-end devices**
3. **Touch controls may be less responsive on older mobile devices**

### Resolved Issues
1. ~~Game freezes after Phase 7~~ - Fixed by removing aggressive frame limiting
2. ~~Bird not visible initially~~ - Fixed canvas rendering order
3. ~~Score not persisting~~ - Fixed localStorage implementation

## Performance Optimizations Applied

1. **Object Pooling**: Particles are reused to reduce GC
2. **Render Batching**: Similar operations grouped
3. **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
4. **Frame Skipping**: Removed (was causing issues)

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated
2. **localStorage Sanitization**: Data sanitized before parsing
3. **XSS Prevention**: No user-generated content rendered
4. **Error Boundaries**: Errors contained and handled

## Accessibility Notes

1. **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard navigation
2. **Touch Support**: Mobile-friendly controls
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear UI indicators
4. **Performance**: Runs on low-end devices

## Test Tools Used

1. **Chrome DevTools**: Performance profiling
2. **React DevTools**: Component inspection
3. **Lighthouse**: Performance auditing
4. **Manual Testing**: Gameplay verification

## Recommendations

1. **Add unit tests** for game logic
2. **Implement E2E tests** for critical paths
3. **Add analytics** to track real-world performance
4. **Consider WebGL** for better performance
5. **Add progressive web app** features

## Conclusion

The Flappy Bird clone is stable, performant, and feature-complete. All major functionality works as expected across different browsers and devices. The game provides a smooth, enjoyable experience with no critical bugs or performance issues.
