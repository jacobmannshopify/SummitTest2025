# Flappy Bird Recreation Roadmap - NextJS Edition (Claude Version)

## Overview
This roadmap provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to recreating the classic Flappy Bird game using modern web technologies. Each step is designed to build upon the previous one, ensuring a smooth development process from setup to deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: CSS Animations & JavaScript requestAnimationFrame
- **State Management**: React useState/useReducer
- **Sound**: Web Audio API
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation

### Step 1: Initialize NextJS Project
Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS support. Configure the project structure with proper folder organization for components, assets, and game logic. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code consistency.

### Step 2: Configure Project Structure
Create the following directory structure:
- `/app` - Next.js app router pages
- `/components` - React components
- `/components/game` - Game-specific components
- `/lib` - Utility functions and game logic
- `/public/assets` - Images and sounds
- `/types` - TypeScript type definitions

### Step 3: Set Up Base Layout
Create a responsive layout that centers the game canvas. Design the layout to work on both desktop and mobile devices. Implement a dark background similar to the original game.

## Phase 2: Core Game Components

### Step 4: Create Game Canvas Component
Build the main game container component that will hold all game elements. Set fixed dimensions (e.g., 288x512px) to match the original game's aspect ratio. Implement proper scaling for different screen sizes.

### Step 5: Implement Bird Component
Create the bird sprite component with proper positioning system. Add gravity physics that constantly pulls the bird down. Implement rotation based on vertical velocity for realistic movement.

### Step 6: Design Pipe Components
Build reusable pipe components (top and bottom). Create a pipe pair component that manages the gap between pipes. Implement proper positioning and sizing logic.

### Step 7: Create Background Elements
Add the scrolling ground component at the bottom. Implement the day/night background with parallax scrolling effect. Ensure seamless looping of background elements.

## Phase 3: Game Physics and Mechanics

### Step 8: Implement Gravity System
Create a physics engine for the bird's movement. Define gravity constant and terminal velocity. Implement smooth falling animation with acceleration.

### Step 9: Add Jump/Flap Mechanics
Implement click/tap detection for flapping. Add upward velocity boost when flapping. Create smooth arc movement with proper physics.

### Step 10: Develop Collision Detection
Build collision detection between bird and pipes. Add ground collision detection. Implement pixel-perfect or bounding box collision system.

### Step 11: Create Pipe Generation System
Implement random pipe height generation within safe bounds. Create pipe spawning at regular intervals. Add pipe removal when off-screen for performance.

## Phase 4: Game States and Flow

### Step 12: Implement Game State Management
Create game states: MENU, PLAYING, GAME_OVER. Build state transition logic. Implement proper cleanup between states.

### Step 13: Design Start Screen
Create attractive start screen with game title. Add "Tap to Start" instruction. Show best score if available.

### Step 14: Build Game Over Screen
Display game over message and final score. Show medal based on score achievement. Add restart button functionality.

### Step 15: Create Score System
Implement score increment when passing pipes. Add score display during gameplay. Create local storage for high score persistence.

## Phase 5: Visual Polish and Animation

### Step 16: Add Bird Animation
Implement wing flapping animation frames. Create death animation sequence. Add subtle hover animation on menu screen.

### Step 17: Implement Smooth Scrolling
Create smooth, continuous background scrolling. Ensure pipe movement is perfectly synchronized. Add parallax effect for depth perception.

### Step 18: Design UI Elements
Create pixel-art style numbers for score display. Design and implement medal system (bronze, silver, gold, platinum). Add button hover and click effects.

### Step 19: Add Visual Effects
Implement screen flash on collision. Add subtle particle effects. Create smooth fade transitions between game states.

## Phase 6: Audio and Feedback

### Step 20: Integrate Sound Effects
Add wing flap sound effect. Implement point scored sound. Create collision/death sound. Add swoosh sound for UI transitions.

### Step 21: Implement Haptic Feedback
Add vibration on mobile devices for collisions. Implement subtle feedback for successful pipe passes.

## Phase 7: Performance and Optimization

### Step 22: Optimize Rendering
Implement requestAnimationFrame for smooth gameplay. Use React.memo for static components. Optimize re-renders with proper state management.

### Step 23: Mobile Optimization
Ensure touch controls work smoothly. Prevent scrolling and zooming during gameplay. Optimize for various mobile screen sizes.

### Step 24: Performance Testing
Test on various devices and browsers. Optimize asset loading and size. Implement lazy loading where appropriate.

## Phase 8: Advanced Features

### Step 25: Add Difficulty Progression
Implement increasing pipe speed over time. Add varying gap sizes based on score. Create dynamic difficulty adjustment.

### Step 26: Implement Leaderboard
Create local leaderboard system. Add name entry for high scores. Display top 10 scores.

### Step 27: Add Game Modes
Create "Easy" mode with larger gaps. Implement "Hard" mode with faster speeds. Add "Night" mode with reduced visibility.

## Phase 9: Polish and Testing

### Step 28: Cross-Browser Testing
Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Ensure consistent behavior across browsers. Fix any browser-specific issues.

### Step 29: Accessibility Features
Add keyboard controls as alternative to mouse/touch. Implement proper ARIA labels. Ensure color contrast meets standards.

### Step 30: Final Polish
Add loading states and error handling. Implement smooth transitions throughout. Create favicon and meta tags.

## Phase 10: Deployment and Launch

### Step 31: Prepare for Production
Optimize build configuration. Set up environment variables. Create production-ready assets.

### Step 32: Deploy to Vercel
Configure Vercel deployment settings. Set up custom domain if desired. Enable analytics and monitoring.

### Step 33: Post-Launch Optimization
Monitor performance metrics. Gather user feedback. Implement improvements based on data.

## Bonus Features (Optional)

### Step 34: Social Features
Add share functionality for scores. Implement Twitter/X integration. Create shareable score cards.

### Step 35: Progressive Web App
Configure PWA manifest. Implement offline functionality. Add install prompt for mobile devices.

### Step 36: Multiplayer Mode
Create local two-player mode. Implement split-screen gameplay. Add competitive scoring system.

## Development Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Get basic mechanics working before adding polish
2. **Test Frequently**: Test each feature as you build it
3. **Mobile First**: Design with mobile in mind from the beginning
4. **Performance Matters**: Keep frame rate smooth (60 FPS target)
5. **Iterate**: Don't aim for perfection on first pass

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1-2: 1-2 days (Setup and basic components)
- Phase 3-4: 2-3 days (Core gameplay)
- Phase 5-6: 2-3 days (Polish and audio)
- Phase 7-8: 2-3 days (Optimization and features)
- Phase 9-10: 1-2 days (Testing and deployment)

**Total: 8-13 days for full implementation**

## Resources Needed
- Bird sprite sheets (flying animation)
- Pipe graphics (top and bottom)
- Background images (day/night)
- Ground texture
- Sound effects (flap, point, hit, die, swoosh)
- Font for score display
- Medal graphics

Remember: The key to recreating Flappy Bird is getting the physics and timing just right. The game's addictive nature comes from its simple yet challenging mechanics, so focus on making the core gameplay feel perfect before adding extra features.
